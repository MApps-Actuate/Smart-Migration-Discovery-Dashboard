	An observational study was performed to determine whether the use of physical restraints in agitated nursing home residents leads to decreased or increased agitation. Results indicate that restraint use does not decrease agitation in nursing home residents. Residents exhibited either the same amount or more agitated behaviors when they were restrained than when they were not restrained, suggesting that the act of restraining may itself contribute to manifestations of agitation. The implications of the use of restraints in agitated nursing home residents are discussed, with particular reference to the prevention of falls.
