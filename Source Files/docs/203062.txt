	Data derived from the 1983-1988 administrations of the American Society of Clinical Pathology Residents In-Service Examination (PRISE) are presented. Data indicate an increase in participation by U.S. and Canadian pathology residency training programs (from 55% in 1983 to approximately 90% in 1988). Demographic data reflect an increase in the proportion of foreign medical graduates (from 24.8% in 1983 to 32.8% in 1988) in U.S. training programs with concomitant decrease in proportion of U.S. medical graduates (from 74.8% to 61.5%, respectively). Canadian residents comprise approximately 5% of the test population. Response surveys from residents and program directors indicate a high degree of satisfaction with the PRISE. In 1988 40.6% of all program directors thought that the PRISE satisfied their objectives very well, and 56% thought that objectives were met satisfactorily. For residents the corresponding rates were 21.2% and 70.7%. Trends in resident group performance in each subspecialty area of pathology, and the implications for residency training are discussed.
