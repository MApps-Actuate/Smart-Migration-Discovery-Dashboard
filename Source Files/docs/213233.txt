	Using computerized hospital discharge abstracts for all Vermont residents hospitalized during 1983 and 1984, we examined the question of whether increased morbidity occurs in patients undergoing secondary (incidental) cholecystectomy. Among a cohort of 4183 patients undergoing a primary surgical procedure in which secondary cholecystectomy might have been considered. 69 patients had a secondary cholecystectomy. The surgical wound infection rate was 8.7% in the secondary cholecystectomy group compared to 2.4% in the rest of the cohort (relative risk, 3.7, 95% C.I. 1.7, 8.1). Other postoperative complications occurred in 10.1% of those undergoing secondary cholecystectomy compared to 4.1% in those who did not (relative risk, 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.2, 5.1). The adjusted relative risk for wound infection was 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4,8.0) and for other surgical complications was 1.7 (95% C.I. 0.8, 3.8). Postoperative length of hospital stay was longer for the secondary cholecystectomy group (mean, 13.8 days) than in the comparison group (mean 8.9 days, p = 0.001). These data suggest that patients undergoing a secondary cholecystectomy may have an increased risk of surgical wound infection and possibly other surgical complications.
