	This paper presents for the first time the annual suicide incidence rates of residents from four Oregon state institutions for a 5-year (1983-1987) period of time. The suicide rate for inmate-patients of the Forensic Psychiatric Program (for the care and treatment of individuals who have been found guilty of serious crime and to be mentally ill) is 820/100,000. This represents a suicide rate 51 times higher than the rate for Marion County or the state of Oregon. This is also one of the highest annual suicide rates ever reported. The suicide rate for patients of the Oregon State Hospital is 289/100,000, which is similar to other reported suicide rates in hospitalized mentally ill populations. This rate is approximately 18 times higher than the rate for Marion County or the state of Oregon. The suicide rate for inmates of Oregon's four correctional institutions is approximately 29/100,000, which is similar to other reported rates for prisoners. This rate is approximately 1.8 times higher than the rate for Marion County or the state of Oregon. The suicide rate for residents of the Fairview Training Center (for care of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled) is zero.
