	To clarify age-related patterns of violent death in childhood, a study was undertaken of medical examiner records concerning 437 deaths of Cook County, Illinois residents, aged younger than 15 years, who died from 1977 through 1982, and whose deaths were ruled as homicides or of an undetermined manner. Males outnumbered females after the age of 1 year. Black children were overrepresented. Perpetrators were usually parents for victims aged younger than 5 years and others for victims aged 5 years or older. Different circumstances of death characterized victims who were younger (mainly beatings) and older (mainly gunshots). Incidence was associated with urban residence and poverty, and it was highest among the youngest and oldest children. Striking differences were found in death rates for age subgroups within standard age groupings (eg, 19.77/100,000 for 1 and 2 years and 6.35/100,000 for 3 and 4 years). Different geographic areas had the highest rates for younger and older victims. We conclude: (1) Separate strategies are needed to protect the two groups at highest risk for homicide: black children aged younger than 3 years and older than 11 years in poor urban areas. (2) Standard homicide reporting practices should include narrow age groupings. (3) Age-related patterns of child homicide must be considered in the planning of prevention trials. (4) Research is needed to clarify why children of different ages are at differing risks in different communities.
