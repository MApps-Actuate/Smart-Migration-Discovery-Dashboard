Physicians have an ethical responsibility for cost-saving within the current medical care delivery system. Noncompliance and overtreatment are among the causes of excessive health care expenses. An effective means of improving compliance and avoiding unwanted or fruitless treatment is improved physician-patient communication. Improved communication is also the most ethical means of avoiding these expenses. The educated participation of patients in treatment decisions and of the public in health policy formation is ethically and economically preferable to bureaucratic responses and user fees. The public must be made aware of the costs and limited benefits of medical treatments and of the effects of lifestyle on health. The medical encounter must become more supportive and educational. Medical school curricula must emphasize patient involvement, which must be reinforced to medical students and residents by staff physicians' genuine concern and effort. Quality assessments and assurance should include evaluation of communication, patient satisfaction, use of follow-up and duplication of services.
