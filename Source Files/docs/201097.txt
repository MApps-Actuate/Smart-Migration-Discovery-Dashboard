	A course on the doctor and his feelings was presented as part of a programme for family medicine residents. The course was led by family physicians and behavioural science professionals who taught as an integrated team. Various teaching techniques were utilized to highlight emotional aspects of the doctor-patient relationship to inexperienced residents. Pre- and post-course assessments suggested there were benefits in a short intensive course of this nature. Possible explanations for the findings are discussed.
