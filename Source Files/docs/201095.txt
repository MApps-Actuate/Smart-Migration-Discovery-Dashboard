	To investigate whether the personal attention paid to a patient can affect his or her subjective recovery from acute tonsillitis, a controlled study was performed on 100 patients consulting a doctor for this disease. At the consultation a randomly assigned experimental group (n = 50) was given more detailed information about the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis and also a more extensive physical examination than a control group (n = 50). At a follow-up interview two days later significantly more of the experimental group felt that their symptoms had improved (P less than 0.005) than the control group, significantly more felt that the treatment had helped them (P less than 0.005) and significantly more felt they had received sufficient information about their illness and treatment (P less than 0.001). A deliberate attempt to maximize the expectation effect was thus shown to influence the clinical course of acute tonsillitis, recorded as the degree of subjective improvement.
