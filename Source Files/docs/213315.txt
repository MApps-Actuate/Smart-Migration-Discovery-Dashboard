	This paper describes a construct validation framework for research on the selection and evaluation of residents. The application of the proposed methodology to surgery residents is described. The need to measure non-cognitive and neuropsychological factors in addition to cognitive knowledge and technical ability is emphasized, and a research strategy that integrates theory formulation, internal validation, and external validation is presented. In this context, residents' competence is viewed as a multivariate construct that requires validation through longitudinal empirical studies and the use of multivariate statistical approaches.
