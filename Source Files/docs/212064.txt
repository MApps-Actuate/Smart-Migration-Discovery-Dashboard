Maintaining a high-quality curriculum for family practice residency training in obstetrics has become increasingly difficult. In 1984 the faculty of the University of Vermont Department of Family Practice needed to upgrade its obstetric curriculum in a community where family practice obstetrics was nonexistent. The key steps to a new curriculum included the recruitment of family practice faculty with experience in obstetrics, expanded communication with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the development of baseline attending privileges in family practice obstetrics, the formation of educational tracks for residents, and the promotion of chart audits. Also important were faculty role modeling, intradepartmental meetings, intensive elective rotations, and community education. This case report of program development in family practice obstetrics may serve as a model to help other residency programs.
