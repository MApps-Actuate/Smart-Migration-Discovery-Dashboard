This paper presents the results of four studies that evaluated the use of neuroleptics in an aging population both in nursing homes and in a psychiatric teaching hospital. The purpose was to determine the degree to which prescribing practices were in compliance with recent court rulings respecting the right of patients to informed consent to "exceptional" medication. The results indicate that physicians in nursing homes do not inform their patients of the risks of neuroleptics, do not seek consent, and do not consider competency to be even an issue. Elderly patients in the acute academic setting were informed of risks and benefits. However, both consent to medication and the competency to give this consent were presumed until or unless the patient failed to acquiesce. The degree to which these practices might be in potential conflict with state law, ignore the benefits of a negotiated doctor/patient partnership, and demonstrate one aspect of poor quality of care are discussed, and policy recommendations are made.
