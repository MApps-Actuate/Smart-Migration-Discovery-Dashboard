	The role of preventive medicine in reducing mortality and morbidity is now widely recognized. Although general practitioners appear to be in an excellent position to offer preventive care, there is evidence that they currently do not detect or intervene for common risk behaviours. One reason for this may be the general practitioner's perception that patients do not expect such preventive activities to be a part of the doctor's role. A postal survey of 309 people randomly selected from the community was undertaken to examine perceptions about the general practitioner's role in detection and intervention for smoking, alcohol abuse, emotional problems and hypertension. Responses to the survey from 264 usable questionnaires indicated that people in the community accepted the general practitioner's role in preventive care, with most respondents indicating that they would appreciate being asked about the risks examined, would like the offer of intervention and would try treatments in these areas offered by the doctor. Few respondents indicated that they would change doctors as a result of preventive activity.
