	Three groups of housewives adhering to strict inclusion criteria were compared along several variables. The groups were patients with non-alcoholic liver disease (N = 19), alcoholic liver disease (N = 15) and alcoholics attending a community treatment centre (N = 13).

There was a strong relationship between dissatisfaction with the role of housewife and severity of alcoholism.
