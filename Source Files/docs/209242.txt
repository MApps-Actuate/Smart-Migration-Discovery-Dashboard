	The Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Arizona has operated a travelers' clinic since 1983, staffed primarily by faculty and residents from the sections of preventive medicine, occupational medicine, and family medicine. We describe the clinic experience in providing preventive medical services to international travelers. Summer months are the busiest. Destinations of the travelers show a clear predominance of travel to less-developed countries, and this is reflected in the immunizations and prescriptions provided. After their trips, travelers reported a low incidence of diarrhea of generally low severity. The travelers' clinic is also a positive experience for resident physicians who help staff it, particularly those specializing in general preventive medicine.
