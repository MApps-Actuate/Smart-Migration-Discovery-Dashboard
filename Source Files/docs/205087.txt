	Fourteen patients receiving multiple antipsychotic drugs in a state mental hospital long-term unit comprised the study sample. They completed a 1-year clinical trial to reduce such drugs to a single antipsychotic agent. Six of the 14 patients were successfully converted to a single antipsychotic drug without clinical deterioration. Eight patients showed marked psychiatric decompensation when converted to single antipsychotic therapy. Factors that may have contributed to this difference are discussed.
