	Because extraordinary benefits accrue to the patient when the surgeon can view the site of disease first-hand, the gastrointestinal surgeon must be a proficient endoscopist, and endoscopy must be part of gastrointestinal surgery. Leaders of surgical organizations and surgeon educators, upon whom rests the responsibility for shaping policy and educating medical students and residents, should remain alert to the need to maintain a substantial surgical presence in gastrointestinal endoscopy.
