	In a series of 604 patients attending an accident and emergency department with chest pain, the decisions made by casualty officers about admission to the coronary care unit were compared with the retrospective opinions of experienced clinical assessors who knew the results of any subsequent investigations. Of the 119 patients whom the assessors judged should have been admitted to the coronary care unit, 14 (11.8 per cent) were judged to have been discharged in error. Of the 485 patients whom the assessors judged should not have been admitted to the coronary care unit, 32 (16 per cent) were judged to have been advised admission unnecessarily. Misinterpretation of the electrocardiographic results was apparently the reason for five of the 14 false negative errors and four of the 32 false positive errors. The median time that patients who were eventually admitted to the coronary care unit spent in the accident and emergency department was 78 min.
