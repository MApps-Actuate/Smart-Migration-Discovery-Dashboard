	This paper presents the results of a state-wide survey of general practitioners in Victoria, Australia. The survey assessed their level of interest in general practice research as well as factors influencing the decision to participate in research. The study was conducted during the formation of a general practice research network which was being linked to a new primary care research unit in the Department of Community Medicine at Monash University. Of the 3350 general practitioners surveyed 1116 responded. One third expressed a high degree of interest in general practice research. Previous research experience and barriers to general practice research were also studied. The areas in which the doctors felt most research was required were identified. The results are compared with another study of Canadian family physicians, which is the only study of a similar nature previously published. The implications of the results are discussed with reference to the future direction of research by general practitioners.
