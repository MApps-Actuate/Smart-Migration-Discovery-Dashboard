	IL-3, a cytokine with hematopoietic differentiating capability, induced murine bone marrow cells to differentiate into cells resembling osteoclasts. The cells resulting from treatment with IL-3 were multi-nucleated and demonstrated tartrate-resistant acid-phosphatase activity, as do resident osteoclasts found in bone. IL-3-induced osteoclast-like cell development in the absence of serum-derived vitamin D metabolites, and a mAb that inhibited IL-3-induced proliferation of an addicted cell line also inhibited the development of osteoclasts in the presence of IL-3. The same Ab had no effect on 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation of osteoclasts. This newly described function of IL-3 may indicate a role for activated T cells in the bone resorption seen with rheumatoid arthritis.
