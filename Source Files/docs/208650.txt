	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates among 1,497 consecutive adult trauma victims triaged from rural and urban sectors to a statewide trauma center in Baltimore were studied. Those studied were 71.7% men, 77.4% whites, 63.2% vehicular trauma victims, 11.2% assault victims, and 25.7% other trauma victims. Non-Baltimoreans predominated (86.0%) and 32.7% were 25 to 39 years of age. Overall, 1.67% of the victims were HIV antibody positive. Significantly higher infection rates were seen in men (1.96% vs. 0.95%; p less than 0.02), non-whites (4.13% vs. 0.95; p less than 0.005), assault victims compared with vehicular and other trauma victims (5.99% vs. 1.06% vs. 1.30%, respectively; p less than 0.001), and Baltimore City residents (3.81% vs. 1.32%; p less than 0.03). Among those 25 to 39 years of age, 68.0% of the HIV infections were noted. Results suggest that HIV infection rates among trauma center patients are a reflection of the patient population served.
