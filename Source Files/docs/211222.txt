	We studied nursing home residents to validate the method used in national surveys for estimating the prevalence of arthritis, and to examine the impact of arthritis on institutionalization and on the physical function of residents. Five homes were studied using a 3-phase approach. Directors of nursing in each home classified residents (n = 629) with respect to the presence of arthritis and senile dementia. The presence of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and their impacts on a resident's initial placement were separately assessed by a physician through a chart review of a stratified subsample. The physician also rated a resident's likelihood of returning to community living. Finally, the functional impact of arthritis was assessed by a physical therapist. The nurses' estimate of the prevalence of arthritis in this population was 23.33%, while the physician estimate was 23.03%. These results are consistent with the 24.6% prevalence found in a 1977 national survey. Arthritis itself was a major cause of nursing home placement in 15% of all residents without dementia. Among those without dementia who also had arthritis, arthritis was a major cause of institutionalization in 31%. None of the residents without dementia showed substantial potential for reintegration into the community. Controlling for age, residents with arthritis had more pain, were more likely to require assistance in functional tasks, and were more likely to use a wheelchair daily than were their fellow residents. Nevertheless, our results suggest that arthritis, despite its impact on function, in and of itself is not a major cause of nursing home placement or ongoing institutionalization.
