	A study was designed to identify criteria that could help select applicants to medical school with a lasting commitment to family medicine and to test the application of such criteria to predict career choice. The sample included 43 residents and physicians who chose family medicine when they entered medical school and five residents who decided on family medicine later. From the initial group, 19 remained stable in their choice of family medicine, and 24 switched to another specialty. Medical school folders and telephone interviews were used as data sources. The characteristics of stable family physicians and those who became specialists were identified, and the predictive power of these criteria was tested with 30 graduates selected at random. Based only on their entrance records, 25 of the 30 graduates were correctly identified as future family physicians or specialists. The use of these criteria in the admission process is discussed in terms of increasing the number of students who will become stable family physicians.
