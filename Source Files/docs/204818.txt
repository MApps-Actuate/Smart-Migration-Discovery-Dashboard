	The prognostic importance of coronary artery disease at the time of elective abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy was evaluated among 131 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota who underwent elective aneurysmectomy from 1971 to 1987 and were followed up to 1988 for death and cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty). Before aneurysmectomy, 75 patients (Group 1) had no clinically recognized coronary disease, 47 patients (Group 2) had suspected or overt uncorrected coronary artery disease (history of prior myocardial infarction, angina or a positive stress test) and 9 patients (Group 3) had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty. The 30 day operative mortality rate was 3% (2 of 75) in Group 1 and 9% (4 of 47) in Group 2 (p = 0.15). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, estimated survival 8 years after aneurysmectomy was 59% (expected rate 68%, p = 0.29) in Group 1 versus 34% (expected rate 61%, p = 0.01) in Group 2. The cumulative incidence rate of cardiac events at 8 years was 15% and 61%, respectively, for patients without and with suspected/overt coronary artery disease (p less than 0.01). Using multivariable proportional hazards analysis, uncorrected coronary artery disease was associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of death (hazard ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 3.00) and a fourfold increased risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio 3.71, 95% confidence interval 1.79 to 7.69). These population-based data support an aggressive life-long approach to the management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.
