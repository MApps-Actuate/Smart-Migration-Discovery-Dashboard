	To investigate the prevalence of vasectomy training in family practice residencies, a national survey of program directors was undertaken, with a response rate of 93%. Of the respondents, 44% had specific residency programs to provide vasectomy training. Of the residencies with specific training programs, training was a requirement in 18%. A majority of programs with training (54%) had both lecture and surgery components, with the remainder having only surgery. In 45% of the programs with training, residents performed five or fewer vasectomies, and in only 22% of the programs did residents perform more than 10 vasectomies. Among the programs where training was elective, 63% of the residents took the training. Only one program reported a medicolegal problem, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement.
